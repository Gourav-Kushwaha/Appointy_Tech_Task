                        A photo showing sled dogs wading through water ankle-deep on top of a melting ice sheet in
                        Greenland
                        has gone viral. The picture taken by Steffen Olsen from the Centre for Ocean and Ice at the
                        Danish
                        Meteorological
                        Institute shows the scale of melting ice in Greenland. Olsen said the ice sheet beneath the
                        water
                        was
                        1.2 metres
                        thick.

                        Lighting is one of the most vital and complicated aspects of photography. Furthermore, it's one
                        of the most underappreciated. The word "photography" has roots in Greek and literally means
                        "drawing with light." Yet beginners often pick up a camera and begin shooting without giving
                        lighting too much though. When it gets dark, they might add on a strobe light. But just like the
                        manual mode on your DSLR, mastering a few lighting fundamentals can set you apart from many
                        other aspiring photographers and take your images to the next level.
